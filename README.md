# Next.js 15: Error rendering simple list in About Page

This repository demonstrates a strange error encountered in a Next.js 15 application when rendering a simple unordered list. The application consists of two pages: a home page and an about page. The about page attempts to render a list of numbers, but the rendering process fails unexpectedly. 

## Bug Description

The about page uses the `data.map` method to render a simple list of numbers, and this seems to be causing the issue. There are no API calls or dynamic data involved in this case, making the error harder to diagnose. 

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. 

You should see the error in your browser's console.
